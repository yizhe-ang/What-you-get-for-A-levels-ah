A simple interactive-ish visualisation of information pertaining to Singapore's university courses.

Since the intent was to simply compare information between the different courses of study, I only extracted data from a single university (National University of Singapore).

The data used and sources are listed as follows:
* **University Admission Scores** - NUS AY2017/2018 Indicative Grade Profile
http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html

* **Median Gross Monthly Salaries & Full-Time Permanent Employment Rate** - NUS Graduate Employment Survey (Nov 2016)

* **Gender Population** - NUS AY2016/2017 Undergraduate Student Enrolment Statistics
